## Part 1: Journey to Khanbaliq

Their journey from the Beggar Clan's territory was fraught with unspoken tensions. Zhang Wuji, Zhou Zhiruo, and the ever-respectful young Han Lin'er rode towards Khanbaliq. Han Lin'er's almost worshipful deference towards Zhang Wuji, despite the latter's attempts at camaraderie, highlighted the rigid hierarchy of their world. Zhou Zhiruo, still grappling with her own secrets and feelings towards Zhao Min, maintained a carefully crafted facade.

Their conversation along the way was a tapestry of veiled accusations and unspoken truths. Zhou Zhiruo subtly steered Zhang Wuji's suspicions towards Zhao Min regarding the missing swords and the supposed death of Yin Li. Zhang Wuji, though bound by his oath to Xie Xun, found himself increasingly drawn to the young girl who had presented a different narrative of the Snake Island tragedy. Zhou Zhiruo, playing on his sympathy, painted Zhao Min as a cunning manipulator.

Reaching Dadu, the grand capital, they found the city abuzz with preparations for the Emperor's "Great Imperial Tour." This display of Yuan power drew a sharp, patriotic rebuke from the young Han Lin'er. "Shameless traitors, fawning over a Tartar Emperor!" he muttered, earning a dangerous glare from a nearby citizen.

The Imperial Tour itself was a spectacle of Yuan might, a seemingly endless procession of soldiers and displays of imperial authority. As two prominent banners proclaiming "Peace to the Nation, Protecting the Country" and "Suppressing Demonic Influence, Subduing the Devil" passed by, a sudden, audacious act of defiance erupted. A flurry of white light flashed through the air, and fourteen expertly thrown daggers struck the banners' flagpoles. The thick poles swayed and snapped, causing chaos and crushing onlookers. Han Lin'er's face lit up with undisguised glee, a cheer caught short by Zhou Zhiruo's swift hand covering his mouth. Mongol elite troops immediately descended upon the panicked crowd, blindly rounding up and executing innocent bystanders.

"The real culprit is long gone! They butcher innocents to vent their rage!" Han Lin'er hissed, his youthful face contorted with fury.

"Hold your tongue, Han Xiongdi!" Zhou Zhiruo warned sharply. "We are here to observe, not to incite chaos." Though silenced, Han Lin'er's burning resentment was palpable, a stark contrast to the forced reverence displayed by the capital's populace. The air in their small inn remained thick with the weight of their individual secrets and conflicting loyalties as they unknowingly moved closer to a fateful encounter.

The "Great Imperial Tour" unfolded, a vibrant spectacle alien to Zhang Wuji and his companions' rural upbringing. Floats boasting the names of powerful Yuan officials paraded by, prompting Zhang Wuji to reflect on the complexities of judging right and wrong.

Then came a jarring disruption. A crudely decorated float, pulled by emaciated horses, depicted a scene that sent a shockwave through Zhang Wuji. A man resembling Xie Xun lay prone, while a young woman in familiar green attire – an unsettling echo of Zhou Zhiruo – attended him. "Miss Zhou," Han Lin'er murmured, "that girl looks like you." Zhou Zhiruo's forced snort and sudden pallor betrayed a deeper reaction, unnoticed by the concerned Zhang Wuji who instinctively took her hand, sensing her distress without understanding its true source.

The following float twisted the knife further. An actress portraying "Zhou Zhiruo" mockingly struck the prone "Xie Xun," then raised a pretend sword to kill him, eliciting cheers from the oblivious crowd. A third float depicted "Xie Xun" and "Zhou Zhiruo" being captured by figures dressed as beggars.

Understanding the cruel intent behind these displays, Zhang Wuji's anger flared. He recognized Zhao Min's hand in this deliberate humiliation. With swift precision, he disabled the horses pulling the third float, plunging the procession into momentary chaos.

[^hundan]: Hundan (混蛋) is a strong and vulgar insult. It's used to call someone a bastard, a scoundrel, a son of a bitch, or an asshole. It carries a heavy connotation of being despicable, contemptible, and thoroughly unpleasant.

"That *little despickable girl*[^hundan] insulted me so!" Zhou Zhiruo choked out, her hand icy in Zhang Wuji's. He tried to reassure her, oblivious to the guilt churning beneath her carefully constructed outrage. "Could it be," Zhou Zhiruo then suggested, her voice laced with false innocence, "that Zhao Min was hiding at the inn and secretly attacked Yifu before we were captured?"

Zhang Wuji considered this, his mind leaning towards the more direct threat of the Xuanming Elders. The seeds of doubt and suspicion, however, had been sown, masking the true culprit standing beside him.

The imperial procession continued, a display of Yuan military might with rows of foreign monks and heavily armed soldiers. Then came a series of ornate sedan chairs carrying various deities, met with fervent prayers from the onlookers. Finally, a grand yellow sedan chair appeared, bearing the frail and dissipated Mongol Emperor, accompanied by his Crown Prince, Ayushiridara.

Zhang Wuji focused his attention on the young Crown Prince. Surprisingly, despite his youth (around fourteen years old, Zhang Wuji estimated), the prince exuded a martial air. A gilded long bow, inlaid with jade, rested on his shoulder, projecting the image of a young Mongolian warrior.

The sight of the Emperor ignited Han Lin'er's fiery resolve once more. "Jiaozhu," he hissed, "let me strike! I can end this tyranny now!" Zhang Wuji, however, restrained him. "No, it's too dangerous. If anyone goes, it would have to be me."

Just then, a seemingly ordinary medicine peddler beside them spoke, his words startling them. "Replacing one tyrant with another rarely works." The man then flashed the Ming Cult's Blazing Fire signal. "Peng Yingyu greets the Jiaozhu." Relief washed over Zhang Wuji at the unexpected appearance of the wise strategist. Peng Yingyu cautioned against assassinating the Emperor in this public spectacle. Zhang Wuji, recognizing his wisdom, nodded in understanding.

As the Emperor's procession moved on, followed by the eager crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the Empress and Princess at the Jade Virtue Palace, Zhou Zhiruo suggested they follow. Mingling with the throng, the four of them – Zhang Wuji, Zhou Zhiruo, Han Lin'er, and the newly arrived Peng Yingyu – made their way towards the palace, unaware of the further drama that awaited them.
